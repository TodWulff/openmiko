# Development


To setup the development environment run `docker-compose up -d` to automatically pull down a container with buildroot.

You can also run `docker pull openmiko/openmiko:latest` to get the latest container. 

The container image is about 8GB. The reason for this is because the artifacts are all baked in.
This reduces the amount of time needed to get up and running.

Once you have the container up and running you can shell into it using:

`docker exec -it -e TERM <containerid> bash` or
`docker-compose exec builder bash`

To build the firmware change you directory to:
`/openmiko/build/buildroot-2016.02` and run `make`.

This should output something like the following:

```
Peforming post rootfs build hooks

```

## Development Loop

The development loop refers to the process of changing a piece of code and running it on the hardware.

Running `make` will bundle up `output/target` as the root filesystem and run the script `buildscripts/postbuild-hook.sh` to create the release. Putting this demo.bin on an sdcard and moving it over is one method of loading it up. Another way is to flash the rootfs or kernel directly using an mtd partition. However this would involve scp'ing it over to the camera provided it is already up and running.


Buildroot has a number of packages out of the box. Run `make menuconfig` and use the graphically interface to select a package. Afterwards you can run `make` and it will build it. You can also run `make-<packagename>` to rebuild that specific package.

Keep in mind space is a concern and the rootfs and kernel can only be a certain size. This is due to the stock bootloader setup to only flash a portion of the 16MB flash chip. This could be changed but would require changing the stock bootloader and flashing a custom one which is not necessarily the best for the end user (who may want to go back to the original firmware).

### Custom Code such as Video Capture Tool / Autonight

Custom code is pulled into the project via git submodules.

After pulling down the submodules with `submodule update --init --recursive` you should run `make ingenic_videocap-rebuild`.


The normal operation of Buildroot is to download a tarball, extract it, configure, compile and install the software component found inside this tarball. It pulls this from the package mk file. However when you are developing you want to use the local code in `/src`. There is a file called `local.mk` that is used to override it.

You can refer to the buildroot documentation at https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html
The section `8.13.6. Using Buildroot during development` addresses that.



## Web Frontend

cd `/src/web/openmiko`
`npm install`

### Source the development environment variables
`. .env.development `

Start the web server (default port 5003)
`npm run serve`



## Bootloader



## Kernel

The kernel is based on Linux 3.10.14. The old kernel version is due to what the manufacturer supports. Porting the changes to a newer kernel would be welcome.



CONFIG_CMDLINE
---

This is set because we are unable to overwrite the default bootloader that comes from the manufacturer in an easy manner. The reason is that the stock bootloader's `sdupdate` command checks for a `demo.bin` that only contains a kernel and root filesystem to flash to NAND. There is no way to update the bootloader itself using this method. Thus whatever kernel we use must use its own arguments to boot from sdcard since we can't change the default arguments.

The commandline chosen boots from `/dev/mmcblk0p2`. Thus we must have a two partition sdcard with the 2nd being an `ext2/3/4` partition.

```
CONFIG_CMDLINE="console=ttyS1,115200n8 mem=96M@0x0 ispmem=8M@0x6000000 rmem=24M@0x6800000 init=/linuxrc root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait rw mtdparts=jz_sfc:256k(boot),2048k(kernel),3392k(root),640k(driver),4736k(appfs),2048k(backupk),640k(backupd),2048k(backupa),256k(config),256k(para),-(flag)"
```

## RootFS




## Buildroot

Rebuild skeleton for rootfs and make changes without having to rebuild everything

```
cd /openmiko/build/buildroot-2016.02/output
rm -rf target
mkdir -p target/sbin
mkdir -p target/lib
mkdir -p target/usr/lib
cp -a staging/sbin/* target/sbin/
cp -a staging/lib/* target/lib/
cp -a staging/usr/lib/* target/usr/lib/
rm -f build/.root
find . -name ".stamp_target_installed*" -print | xargs rm -f
```


### Fitting things into the root filesystem

There is a utility called print_compression.py that goes through the output/target directory and tries to xz each file up individually and get the compressed value into a CSV.

This utility can give you a better idea of what you can remove.

When attempting to shrink the root file system unselecting items from the buildroot menu doesn't work.
It will still remain in the output target directory. You have to manually go into the output target and delete each of the files. This is a pain because you sometimes don't know all the random library files and such. But usually you can give a good guess.



### Building busybox static binary for use in initramfs

Since we use initramfs and bundle in a starting root filesystem into the kernel we need some small utilities to populate it to start. The file `config/busybox-min.conf` is used for a minimal busybox static binary compilation.

You can copy this file over to the `output/build/busybox-version`

After the binary is built copy it to `initramfs_root/bin`

Then remake the initramfs filesystem:

```
make rootfs-initramfs
```
